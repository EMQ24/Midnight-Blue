    <p>Press the Play button. Simon will repeat his first signal. If you didn't enable hard mode, the note played will
        be highlighted. Repeat the signal by pressing the same note.</p>
    <p>Simon will repeat the first signal and add another. Repeat these two signals by pressing the same notes, in
        order.</p>
    <p>Simon will repeat these first two signals and add yet another. Continue playing as long as you can repeat each
        sequence of notes correctly. After every 3rd note in a sequence, Simon automatically speeds up. Click the bulb
        to toggle hard mode and the speaker to toggle non-piano sound effects.</p>
